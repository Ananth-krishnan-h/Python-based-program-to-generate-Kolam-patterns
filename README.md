Generating a Kolam pattern using Python is a great project for learning about algorithms, geometry, and graphics. The project you've outlined uses a Flask backend to serve a static web page and a Python script to generate the patterns. The process involves setting up a virtual environment and installing dependencies before running the Flask application.

Project Structure and Setup
To get started, make sure you have the following files in a single folder:

index.html: The front-end web page that will display the kolam.

style.css: The stylesheet for the HTML page.

requirements.txt: A file listing all the necessary Python libraries (e.g., Flask, Pillow, etc.).

app.py: A Flask application that serves index.html and handles the kolam generation request.

kolam_project.py: The core Python script that contains the logic for generating the kolam pattern. This script should produce an output file, such as final_generated_kolam.png.

Preparing the Python Environment
To manage project dependencies effectively, use a virtual environment. This isolates the project's libraries from your system's global Python installation.

Open your terminal (Git Bash, PowerShell, or Command Prompt on Windows).

Navigate to your project directory using the cd command.

Create a virtual environment:

Bash

python -m venv venv
Activate the virtual environment. On Windows, use:

Bash

venv\Scripts\activate.bat
On macOS/Linux, use:

Bash

source venv/bin/activate
Once the environment is active, upgrade pip and install the required packages listed in your requirements.txt file:

Bash

python -m pip install --upgrade pip
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
Note: If you encounter issues with TensorFlow and don't have a GPU, you can try replacing tensorflow with tensorflow-cpu in your requirements.txt file before running the installation command.

Running the Flask Backend
After setting up the virtual environment and installing dependencies, you can start the web server.

Make sure your virtual environment is still active.

Run the Flask application with the following command:

Bash

python app.py
You should see output indicating that Flask is running and listening on http://0.0.0.0:5000/. You can now open this URL in your web browser to view your Kolam generator application.
